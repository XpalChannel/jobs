## About Xpal PoC Channel
                                    

The Xpal PoC Channel, utilizes the concept of payment channels to provide bi-directional monetary transfers focused on high speed, zero counterparty risk, and lowest fees according of sharing gas protocol of PoC.

By taking transactions off-chain, the Xpal Network is ultimately designed to alleviate scalability concerns on the Ethereum platform for first step and will accept for other blockchains in future. 

Xpal Network is building a second-layer payment solution for the Ethereum blockchain. 

The project is near to the same technological innovations pioneered by the Bitcoin Lightning Network by facilitating transactions off-chain, but focuses on support for PoC credit instant payment and shared-gas protocol for first time in all ERC-20 complaint tokens. 

Participants will transact directly through Xpal PoC Payment Channels with settling transactions on the Xplal blockchain, helping to avoid bottlenecks related to processing numerous and often lowest payment transactions.

PoC transfers can create a network of payment channels, which connect any two parties looking to transact, without needing to have a direct channel established between the parties themselves. Inter-channel funds can then deposited in hashlocked smart contracts from the payee, through the chain of intermediaries, to the payer. At first, two participants plan to opening a new channel requires locking up assets via an on-chain broadcasted transaction.
